Summary:
Despite the travesties of 2020, artificial intelligence has quickened its progress . Baidu upped its performance across vaccines, autonomous vehicles, language processing, and quantum computing . This article outlines five significant advances with implications for combating covid-19 .
Machine learning models can predict which subcomponents are the most immunogenic . The use of AI in vaccine development may revolutionize the way all vaccines are created in the future . In February, Baidu opened its LinearFold AI algorithm for scientific and medical teams working to fight the virus .
The key breakthrough of covid-19 vaccines has been the development of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines . Instead of inserting a small portion of a virus to trigger a human immune response, mRNA teaches cells how to make a protein that can prompt an immune response .
In December, Baidu unveiled PaddleHelix, a machine learning-based bio-computing framework aimed at facilitating the development of vaccine design, drug discovery, and precision medicine . Autonomous driving technology continued to mature in 2020, with the industry’s leading companies testing driverless cars .
At Baidu World 2020, the company demonstrated its fully automated driving capability . The AI system drives independently without an in-vehicle safety driver . In 2020, natural language systems became significantly more advanced at processing aspects of human language .
Baidu’s ERNIE-GEN performs at an elite level across a range of language generation tasks, including dialogue engagement, question generation, and abstractive summarization . The model also achieved significant progress in visual understanding, ranking first on the VCR leaderboard, a dataset of 290,000 questions .
Quantum computing made significant inroads in 2020, including the Jiuzhang computer’s achievement of quantum supremacy . This carries significance for AI, since quantum computing has potential to supercharge AI applications compared to binary-based classical computers .
In May, Baidu launched Paddle Quantum, a quantum machine learning development toolkit that can help scientists and developers quickly build and train quantum neural network models . The open-source toolkit both supports developers building quantum AI applications and helps deep learning enthusiasts develop quantum computing .
At Baidu World 2020, the company offered a glimpse into its next-generation AI processor, the Kunlun 2 . The chip uses 7 nanometer (nm) processing technology and its maximum computational capability is over three times that of the previous generation .
MIT Technology Review gets a first look at the much-anticipated big new language model from OpenAI . How it works is even more deeply under wraps . Can anti-aging breakthroughs add 10 healthy years to the human life span? The CEO of OpenAI is paying to find out.
MIT Technology Review is a collaboration between MIT and the University of Cambridge, Massachusetts . The company is developing a new system for the next generation of high-end computers . The technology company has been in talks with the MIT team at the center of the MIT Institute of Technology for decades .

Summary:
Artificial intelligence (AI) enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decision making . Darrell West and John Allen discuss AI's application across a variety of sectors, address issues in its development, and offer recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values .
Despite widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life . It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking .
AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention” These software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up .
Artificial intelligence is already altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance . AI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics . Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data .
AI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors . This includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities .
A project by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated that “artificial intelligence technologies could increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14% by 2030” China is making rapid strides because it has set a national goal of investing $150 billion in AI and becoming a global leader in this area by 2030 .
Investments in financial AI in the U.S. tripled between 2013 and 2014 to a total of $12.2 billion . China currently lags the United States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment . The sheer size of its AI market gives that country tremendous opportunities for pilot testing .
High-frequency trading by machines has replaced much of human decisionmaking . Machines can spot inefficiencies or market differentials on a very small scale and execute trades that make money . Fraud detection represents another way AI is helpful in financial systems .
Artificial intelligence will accelerate the traditional process of warfare so rapidly that a new term has been coined: hyperwar . The big data analytics associated with AI will profoundly affect intelligence analysis, as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time .
War is a time competitive process, where the side able to decide the fastest and move most quickly to execution will generally prevail . Artificial intelligence systems tied to AI-assisted command and control systems can move decision support and decisionmaking to a speed vastly superior to the speeds of the traditional means of waging war .
The proliferation of zero day or zero second cyber threats will challenge even the most sophisticated signature-based cyber protection . The challenge in the West of where to position “humans in the loop” in a hyperwar scenario will ultimately dictate the West’s capacity to be competitive in this new form of conflict .
Preparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority . China, Russia, North Korea, and other countries are putting substantial resources into AI . China’s State Council issued a plan for the country to “build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion” by 2030 .
German company applies deep learning to medical issues . It has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images”
The city of Chicago has developed an AI-driven ‘Strategic Subject List’ that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators . It ranks 400,000 people on a scale of 0 to 500, using items such as age, criminal activity, victimization, drug arrest records, and gang affiliation .
Experts claim AI programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system . Critics worry that AI algorithms represent “a secret system to punish citizens for crimes they haven’t yet committed”
In China, companies already have “considerable resources and access to voices, faces and other biometric data in vast quantities” New technologies make it possible to match images and voices with other types of information, and to use AI on these combined data sets to improve law enforcement and national security .
Autonomous vehicles—cars, trucks, buses, and drone delivery systems—use advanced technological capabilities . Features include automated vehicle guidance and braking, lane-changing systems, the use of AI to analyze information in real time .
Advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change . This means that software is the key—not the physical car or truck itself .
All of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars . Uber recently signed an agreement to purchase 24,000 autonomous cars from Volvo . Uber suffered a setback in March 2018 when one of its autonomous vehicles in Arizona hit and killed a pedestrian .
The Cincinnati Fire Department is using data analytics to optimize medical emergency responses . Cincinnati officials are deploying this technology to prioritize responses and determine the best ways to handle emergencies . They see AI as a way to deal with large volumes of data and figure out efficient ways of responding to public requests .
Fast Company ranked American locales and found Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City as the top adopters . 66 percent of American cities are investing in smart city technology, according to a National League of Cities report .
The increasing penetration of AI and autonomous devices into many aspects of life is altering operations and decisionmaking within organizations . At the same time, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues . How should we promote data access? How do we guard against biased or unfair data used in algorithms?
AI depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems . Having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research community is a prerequisite for successful AI development . McKinsey Global Institute study: Nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see AI advances .
In some instances, certain AI systems are thought to have enabled discriminatory or biased practices . Airbnb has been accused of having homeowners on its platform who discriminate against racial minorities . We outline ways to improve data access for researchers .
The rise of automation and the increased reliance on algorithms for high-stakes decisions such as whether someone get insurance or not, your likelihood to default on a loan or somebody’s risk of recidivism means this is something that needs to be addressed . Algorithms embed ethical considerations and value choices into program decisions .
In the U.S., many urban schools use algorithms for enrollment decisions based on a variety of factors such as neighborhood qualities, income level, and demographic background . Depending on how AI systems are set up, they can facilitate the redlining of mortgage applications, help people discriminate against individuals they don't like .
The EU is implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 . People have “the right to opt out of personally tailored ads” and “can contest ‘legal or similarly significant’ decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention”
Uber-related fatality in Arizona will be an important test case for legal liability . Arizona actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company latitude in terms of road testing . Digital platforms often have limited liability for what happens on their sites .
The U.S. should develop a data strategy that promotes innovation and consumer protection, authors say . Right now, there are no uniform standards in terms of data access, data sharing, or data protectio .
AI requires data to test and improve its learning capacity . Without structured and unstructured data sets, it will be nearly impossible to gain the full benefits of artificial intelligence . In general, the research community needs better access to government and business data .
In the U.S., there are no uniform standards in terms of data access, data sharing, or data protection . Google long has made available search results in aggregated form for researchers and the general public . Twitter makes much of its tweets available to researchers through application programming interfaces .
Governments can facilitate collaboration by building infrastructure that shares data . National Cancer Institute pioneered a data-sharing protocol where certified researchers can query health data it has using de-identified information drawn from clinical data, claims information, and drug therapies .
The federal government already has put over 230,000 data sets into the public domain . This has propelled innovation and aided improvements in AI and data analytic technologies . The private sector also needs to facilitate research data access so that society can achieve the benefits of artificial intelligence .
As AI applications accelerate across many sectors, it is vital that we reimagine our educational institutions for a world where AI will be ubiquitous . Right now, many students do not receive instruction in the kinds of skills that will be needed in an AI-dominated landscape .
In 2017, the National Science Foundation funded over 6,500 graduate students in computer-related fields . The goal is to build a larger pipeline of AI and data analytic personnel so that the U.S. can reap the full advantages of the knowledge revolution .
IBM’s Teacher Advisor program helps teachers bring the latest knowledge into the classroom . Watson's free online tools enable instructors to develop new lesson plans in STEM and non-STEM fields . Federal officials need to think about how they deal with artificial intelligence .
The legislation provides a mechanism for the federal government to get advice on ways to promote a “climate of investment and innovation to ensure the global competitiveness of the United States’s . The committee is directed to submit a report to Congress and the administration 540 days after enactment regarding any legislative or administrative action .
Waiting nearly two years for a committee report will certainly result in missed opportunities and a lack of action on important issues . States and localities also are taking action on AI . New York City Council unanimously passed a bill that directed the mayor to form a taskforce that would “monitor the fairness and validity of algorithms used by municipal agencies”
The taskforce is scheduled to report back to the mayor on a range of AI policy, legal, and regulatory issues by late 2019 . Some observers are worrying that the taskforce won’t go far enough in holding algorithms accountable .
The European Union has taken a restrictive stance on these issues of data collection and analysis . It has rules limiting the ability of companies from collecting data on road conditions and mapping street views . The EU has fined technology firms, demanded copies of data, and placed limits on the material collected .
New rules give citizens the right to review how digital services made algorithmic choices affecting people . By taking a restrictive stance on issues of data collection and analysis, the European Union is putting its manufacturers and software designers at a significant disadvantage to the rest of the world .
Regulating individual algorithms will limit innovation and make it difficult for companies to make use of artificial intelligence . Bias and discrimination are serious issues for AI. Existing statutes governing discrimination in the physical economy need to be extended to digital platforms .
Some individuals have argued that there needs to be avenues for humans to exercise oversight and control of AI systems . Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence CEO Oren Etzioni argues there should be rules for regulating these systems . He says AI must be governed by laws that already have been developed for human behavior .
The IEEE Global Initiative has ethical guidelines for AI and autonomous systems . Software designs should be programmed for “nondeception” and “honesty,” according to ethics experts . When failures occur, there must be mitigation mechanisms to deal with the consequences .
Using the trolley problem as a moral dilemma, they ask the question: If an autonomous car goes out of control, should it be programmed to kill its own passengers or pedestrians who are crossing the street? They devised a “voting-based system” that asked 1.3 million people to assess alternative scenarios .
The malevolent use of AI exposes individuals and organizations to unnecessary risks and undermines the virtues of the emerging technology . Efforts to hijack AI in order to solicit confidential information should be seriously penalized . Countries have to be careful to safeguard their own systems and keep other nations from damaging their security .
The world is on the cusp of revolutionizing many sectors through artificial intelligence and data analytics . There already are significant deployments in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities . Yet the manner in which AI systems unfold has major implications for society as a whole .
Human choices about software development affect the way in which decisions are made and the manner in which they are integrated into organizational routines . Exactly how these processes are executed need to be better understood because they will have substantial impact on the general public soon, and for the foreseeable future .
Brookings recognizes that the value it provides is in its absolute commitment to quality, independence, and impact . John R. Allen is a member of the Board of Advisors of Amida Technology and Spark Cognition .

Summary:
Adoption of AI has more than doubled since 2017, though the proportion of organizations using AI has plateaued . Companies seeing the highest financial returns from AI continue to pull ahead of competitors . On talent, for the first time, we looked closely at AI hiring and upskilling .
This marks the fifth consecutive year weâve conducted research globally on AI’s role in business . Over the past five years we have tracked the leaders in AI . We see more indications that these leaders are expanding their competitive advantage .
AI high performers are more likely than others to follow core practices that unlock value, such as linking their AI strategy to business outcomesÂ (Exhibit 1) They are engaging more often in frontier practices that enable AI development and deployment at scale, or what some call the âindustrialization of AIÂ of AI .
AI high performers are more likely to follow advanced scaling practices, such as using standardized tool sets to create production-ready data pipelines and using an end-to-end platform for AI-related data science, data engineering, and application development that theyâve developed in-house . High performers might also have a head start on managing potential AI risks that other organizations have not addressed yet .
Of respondents from organizations that have adopted AI, 43 percent say their organizations are using AI to assist in sustainability efforts . 40 percent say they are working to reduce the environmental impact of their AI use . High performers are 1.4 times more likely to report AI-enabled sustainability efforts than others .
When asked about the types of sustainability efforts using AI, respondents most often mention initiatives to improve environmental impact, such as optimization of energy efficiency or waste reduction . Both efforts are more commonly seen at organizations based in Greater China, AsiaâPacific, and developing markets, while respondents in North America are least likely to report them .
Respondents at AI high performers are nearly eight times more likely than their peers to say their organizations spend at least 20 percent of their digital-technology budgets on AI-related technologies . These organizations have less difficulty hiring for roles such as AI data scientist and data engineer .
All organizations report that hiring AI talent, particularly data scientists, remains difficult . The most popular strategy among all respondents is reskilling existing employees . Recruiting from top-tier universities as well as from technology companies that arenât in the top tier .
These companies are doing more than others to recruit AI-related talent from various sources . High performers are more likely to recruit from top-tier universities and tech companies than others . They're also likely to source talent from other universities, training academies, and diversity-focused programs .
High performers are much more likely than other organizations to go beyond providing access to self-directed online course work to upskill nontechnical employees on AI . Respondents at high performers are nearly twice as likely as others to report offering peer-to-peer learning and certification programs to nontechnical personnel .
29 percent of respondents say their organizations have no minority employees working on their AI solutions . Thereâs more being done to improve gender diversity than ethnic diversity . McKinsey: Research shows a correlation between diversity and outperformance .
The online survey was in the field from May 3 to May 27, 2022, and from August 15 to August 17, 2022 . It garnered responses from 1,492 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures . Of those respondents, 744 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one function .

Summary:
Artificial intelligence is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence . Machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry . From the development of self-driving cars to the proliferation of smart assistants, AI is increasingly becoming part of everyday life .
AI experts typically distinguish between strong AI and weak AI . Strong AI is a machine that can solve problems it’s never been trained to work on . This is the kind of AI we see in movies, like the robots from Westworld or the character Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation .
Weak AI is a simulation of human intelligence applied to a narrowly defined problem . Strong AI represents a machine with a full set of cognitive abilities, but time hasn't eased the difficulty of achieving such a feat .
A machine learning algorithm is fed data by a computer and uses statistical techniques to help it ‘learn’ how to get progressively better at a task . ML algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values . Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through a biologically inspired neural network architecture .
A reactive machine cannot store a memory and, as a result, cannot rely on past experiences to inform decision making in real time . Limited memory AI has the ability to store previous data and predictions when gathering information and weighing potential decisions .
Theory of mind is just that — theoretical. We have not yet achieved the technological and scientific capabilities necessary to reach this next level of AI . The concept is based on the psychological premise of understanding that other living things have thoughts and emotions that affect the behavior of one’s self .
The final step will be for AI to become self-aware . This kind of AI possesses human-level consciousness and understands its own existence in the world . It would be able to understand what others may need based on not just what they communicate to them but how they communicate it .
Snapchat filters use ML algorithms to distinguish between an image’s subject and the background, track facial movements and adjust the image on the screen based on what the user is doing . Self-driving cars are a recognizable example of deep learning, since they use deep neural networks to detect objects around them .
AI companies raised $66.8 billion in funding in 2022, according to CB Insights research, more than doubling the amount raised in 2020 . MuZero, a computer program created by DeepMind, is a promising frontrunner in the quest to achieve true artificial general intelligence .
The application of AI in banking could lead to upwards of $400 billion in savings . The market for AI in media and entertainment is estimated to reach $99.48 billion by 2030 . The Pew Research Center surveyed 10,260 Americans in 2021 on their attitudes toward AI .
More than 40 percent of respondents said they considered driverless cars to be bad for society . The idea of using AI to identify the spread of false information on social media was more well received, with close to 40 percent labeling it a good idea .
Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years while the cost of computers is halved . Recent research found that AI innovation has actually outperformed Moore's Law, doubling every six months or so as opposed to two years .
The history of AI as we think of it today spans less than a century . 42 artificial intelligence companies are working on some very smart technology . Gaming companies use artificial intelligence to improve their products and enhance overall gaming experience .

Summary:
The Bored Panda iOS app is live! Fight boredom with iPhones and iPads here . Please provide your email address and we will send your password shortly . To complete the subscription process, please click the link in the email we just sent you .
A whopping 2.5 million people follow the 'Cats on Catnip' page . The memes are excellent, the jokes are relatable, and we’re already feeling the urge to adopt (another) cat from the local animal shelter .
The page shares quality cat content, consistently, and has won over the hearts, minds, and food bowls of many an internet user . We feel there’s never going to be a shortage of memes about them because they’re far too interesting and silly as animals .
The two most common types of content that go viral are animals and food . Though humor isn’t necessary, it can help content spread across the net . Relatability is a more crucial component because this is the factor that often inspires people to share the content with others .
Cats are very much solitary and watchful creatures. They love to watch the world go by from high places and sleep a lot . Vet Nurse Nina Downing from the PDSA, from the UK’s leading vet charity, recently told Bored Panda about feline behavior .
Eating is a moment for cats where they expose themselves and cannot really check what's behind them . They often feel more comfortable when they have a person (or another cat) they trust in the same room watching their back . PDSA told us that one way to recognize that you’re a great owner is when your cats feel confident enough have a ‘mad half-hour” where they suddenly become full of fun and excitement .
Owners need to regulate what their cats eat, and how much they eat, in order to help them stay lean, fit, and content . “If your cat is happy and confident enough to display this kind of behavior, you can congratulate yourself on being a great cat owner as your cat feels very comfortable in your company.”
90% of a cat’s weight loss journey depends on its diet . The rest is related to physical activity . ‘I strongly encourage cat owners to weigh the food using a kitchen scale,’ Dr. Ward said .
Even feeding as few as ten extra kibbles each day can add up to a pound of weight gain in a year for a cat . Work with your vet to adjust the diet or calories every three months if your cat isn't losing weight .
Three play sessions, each five minutes long, are enough to help cats reach their fitness goals . Cats can safely lose from 1% to 3% of their body mass each month… so long as they’re using a vet-supervised program . ‘hunter feeders’ and food puzzles to engage a cat's ‘inner predator’
If a cat loses too much weight too quickly or is fed too little, it can develop a life-threatening form of liver failure, so be sure to work closely with your veterinarian before beginning any diet program with your cat . It’s not easy taking care of your cat, but it's very much worth it to see them living their best lives .
See how close the cat is, actually touching and even rubbing up against the man's leg ? That's the emotional reaction . You are supposed to say "Thank you".    To be honest the one on the right is more realistic and lovely..
